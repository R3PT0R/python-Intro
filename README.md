## Why You Should Learn Python:
Python is an interpreted,tottaly-not complicated, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.Python is much less complex then most proggraming languages.Python is used in robots and prototypes too! wow i never typed to fast in my life! 

## Variables:
Variables is something used to store data in. It is very easy to make a variable and is probably one of of the most easy things in Python.There is a few example with diffrent data types below below.
```python
example = Example #str
example = 10 #int
```
## Printing Variables and other things:
Printing variables and other things is very easy. To print a variable, just go to your terminal and write the variables name and it will print the value. Printing other things is also very easy but requires diffrent code. The neccesery code is written below.
```python
print('Hello')
```
## If/Else Statements:
If/Else are conditions. Lets say you want your program to do this: If the ice cream costs below $20, ill buy it and if it doesnt, buy a choclate.The example will give you a better understanding:
```python
if (1 < 2):
  print('1 is less then 2')
else:
  print('1 is bigger then 2')
```
## For Loops:
If you don't like mashing buttons or spending too much time doing something again and again I get that, im lazy most of the time too ðŸ˜†.Ok now let me teach you how to loop a program.Trust me, you are going to be finishing work faster then The Flash.The loop is simple, it does work for you. First, write what you want to be prinnted multiple times in a variable.
once you are done typing, write for x in {variable name} and in a new line write print(x). If you dont understand you can look below â†“
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```
## Data Types:
There are many diffrent data types in Python. But for now im going to teach you the 2 basics, Strings and Integers. Strings are words but they have no value. If you put the number "1" in a string, it wont have any value the computer will take it as a word. integers are something diffrent. If you write ```print(1436+4-2)``` it will give you the answer. if you try it like ```print('1436+4-2')``` it will show it as an error. You can learn other data types like Floating-Point Numbers, Complex Numbers and Raw Strings. These are other Data Types but are a bit complicated. You can learn them here: https://realpython.com/python-data-types/

## Input:
Input is a function you use to take and collect data from someone or something. Its very simple. First make a variable, then
put something the user answers to and the terminal will print it. The code might give you a better understanding.
```python
Var1 = input('How is your day?')
```
## Dictionary
Dictionary, also known as databases are something used to store data and also print it. Online stores like Amazaon and Ebay uses very complicated dictionaries. But i am not a rocket coder(not sure is thats a thing), I am a 10-Year-Old boy who is writing a Python book. I will give an example of it below â†“
``` python
print('welcome to the choclate shop')

myDict = {'name': 'Hershey', 'maker': 'Hershey Co.', 'Price': '$1.50'}

print("Dictionary Items : ", myDict)

print("/nDictionary Key - name : ", myDict['name'])
print("Dictionary Key - maker : ", myDict['maker'])
print("Dictionary Key - Price : ", myDict['Price'])
```
## Confronting and fixing errors:
Errors are okay to make. Errors in coding can be fustrating as you have to scan through every line of code and most of the time its rather one thing that makes the whole programe go broken. These are the normal and most common errors:
1. Syntax Errors:
These errors happen when wrong code is put into the code. I face these errors when I copy random code from random websites. You can trust StackOverFlow and GitHub because they are well mantained websites. However there are many other websites that might not be that famous and have correct answers so its okay to use code from other websites too. How to fix Syntax errors: Think what you are trting to do then go to a trust worthy websites and write it down.
