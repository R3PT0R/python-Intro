## Why You Should Learn Python:
Python is an interpreted,tottaly-not complicated, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.Python is much less complex then most proggraming languages.Python is used in robots and prototypes too! wow i never typed to fast in my life! 

## Variables:
Variables is something used to store data in. It is very easy to make a variable and is probably one of of the most easy things in Python.There is a few example with diffrent data types below below.
```python
example = Example #str
example = 10 #int
```
## Printing Variables and other things:
Printing variables and other things is very easy. To print a variable, just go to your terminal and write the variables name and it will print the value. Printing other things is also very easy but requires diffrent code. The neccesery code is written below.
```python
print('Hello')
```
## If/Else Statements:
If/Else are conditions. Lets say you want your program to do this: If the ice cream costs below $20, ill buy it and if it doesnt, buy a choclate.The example will give you a better understanding:
```python
if (1 < 2):
  print('1 is less then 2')
else:
  print('1 is bigger then 2')
```
## For Loops:
If you don't like mashing buttons or spending too much time doing something again and again I get that, im lazy most of the time too ðŸ˜†.Ok now let me teach you how to loop a program.Trust me, you are going to be finishing work faster then The Flash.The loop is simple, it does work for you. First, write what you want to be prinnted multiple times in a variable.
once you are done typing, write for x in {variable name} and in a new line write print(x). If you dont understand you can look below â†“
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```
