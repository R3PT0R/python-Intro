## Why You Should Learn Python:
Python is an interpreted,tottaly-not complicated, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.Python is much less complex then most proggraming languages.Python is used in robots and prototypes too! wow i never typed to fast in my life!
#### Did You Know!: Python can automate the Boring Stuff. No need to change something again and again!



## Variables:
Variables are something used to store data in. It is very easy to make a variable and is probably one of of the most easy things in Python.There is a few example with diffrent data types below below.
```python
jar = "sugar" #str
wallet = 10 #int
```

#### Did You Know!: Variables are like a special jar. You can keep data in it, use it for later or ask it what the data is! 

## Printing Variables and other things:
Printing variables and other things is very easy. To print a variable, just go to your terminal and write the variables name and it will print the value. Printing other things is also very easy but requires diffrent code. The neccesery code is written below.
```python
print('Hello')
```
#### Did You Know!: You can print something many times using a loop.

## If/Else Statements:
If/Else are conditions. Lets say you want your program to do this: If the ice cream costs below $20, ill buy it and if it doesnt, buy a choclate.The example will give you a better understanding:
```python
ice_cream = 20
if ice_cream == 20:
  print('Lets buy it!')
else:
  print('Too expensive!')
```
#### Did You Know!: If/Else statments can be used for responding to questions.

## For Loops:
If you don't like mashing buttons or spending too much time doing something again and again I get that, im lazy most of the time too ðŸ˜†.Ok now let me show you how to loop a program.Trust me, you are going to be finishing work faster then The Flash.The loop is simple, it does work for you. First, write what you want to be prinnted multiple times in a variable.
once you are done typing, write for x in {variable name} and in a new line write print(x). If you dont understand you can look below â†“
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```
#### Did You Know!: Use this to loop something you don't wan't to type! (Its a good way to save time and energy.)

## Data Types:
There are many diffrent data types in Python. But for now im going to teach you the 2 basics, Strings and Integers. Strings are words but they have no value. If you put the number "1" in a string, it wont have any value the computer will take it as a word. integers are something diffrent. If you write ```print(1436+4-2)``` it will give you the answer. if you try it like ```print('1436+4-2')``` it will show it as an error. You can learn other data types like Floating-Point Numbers, Complex Numbers and Raw Strings. These are other Data Types but are a bit complicated. You can learn them here: https://realpython.com/python-data-types/

#### Did You Know!: Data types are used to state a certain type of data.

## Input:
Input is a function you use to take and collect data from someone or something. Its very simple. First make a variable, then
put something the user answers to and the terminal will print it. The code might give you a better understanding.
```python
Var1 = input('How is your day?')
```
#### Did You Know!: This is a must use in MANY,MANY games!

## Dictionary
Dictionary, also known as databases are something used to store data and also print it. Online stores like Amazaon and Ebay uses very complicated dictionaries. But i am not a rocket coder(not sure is thats a thing), I am a 10-Year-Old boy who is writing a Python book. I will give an example of it below â†“
``` python
print('welcome to the choclate shop')

myDict = {'name': 'Hershey', 'maker': 'Hershey Co.', 'Price': '$1.50'}

print("Dictionary Items : ", myDict)

print("/nDictionary Key - name : ", myDict['name'])
print("Dictionary Key - maker : ", myDict['maker'])
print("Dictionary Key - Price : ", myDict['Price'])
```
#### Did You Know!: Use dictionaries to print down a CERTAIN key!

## Confronting and fixing errors
Errors are very common but it is important to know how to fix them. To find an error in your code just run your code in the terminal and it will point it out if there is any.Now i will show you the most common errors and how to fix them.
1.Spotting Errors:
Most errors are spotted in the Terminal when you run it, but an error will have a red string underneath it.
1.Syntax error
To fix this, The terminal will point out wich line the problem is in. Go to the line and fix whatever problem there is if you cannot find the problem, search the problem up and see if there is any option on the web.
1.Typos
To fix this just correct your spelling
1.Indentation Error
Change Python (.py) files to use 4-space indents and no hard tab characters. Also trim excess spaces and tabs from ends of lines, and remove empty lines at the end of files. Also ensure the last line ends with a newline.
#### Did You Know!: Errors are no fun. But, if there are no errors there would be no right answers either!

## Review: Make a Simple Program
Now you have learnt the basics! Lets make a simple program. After this you can go on to the Advanced levels.
Requirments:
1. The program must work
1. Must have a Variable, a If/Else Statment and a print function
1. Give a line of code of your choice
1. Have fun ðŸ™‚
